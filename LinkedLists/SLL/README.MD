# Singly linked list
implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure

## Linked list methods
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
* append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* prepend(value) which add a new node before head
* insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
* reverse reverses linked list with head point to null and tail point to head in a new list
* remove() removes the provided offset value from linked list
* serialize: does same job as JSON.stringigy()
* deserialize: same as JSON.parse()
